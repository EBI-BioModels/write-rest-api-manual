It is demonstrated that inevitable stochastic forces existing in all three cell species are able to suppress tumor cell growth completely. Whereas the deterministic model does not reveal a stable tumor-free state, the auto-correlated noise combined with cross-correlation functions can either lead to tumor-dormant states, tumor progression, as well as to an elimination of tumor cells. The auto-correlation function exhibits a finite correlation time τ, while the cross-correlation functions shows a white-noise behavior. The evolution of each of the three kinds of cells leads to a multiplicative noise coupling. The model is investigated by means of a multivariate Fokker-Planck equation for small τ. The different behavior of the system is, above all, determined by the variation of the correlation time and the strength of the cross-correlation between tumor and tumor-detecting cells. The theoretical model is based on a biological background discussed in detail, and the results are tested using realistic parameters from experimental observations.</pre>\r\n      </body>\r\n    </notes>",
